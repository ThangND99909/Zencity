This guide sets forth the expectations, etiquette, and foundational principles for all students training virtually through Chuan Wu Kung Fu Institute and Zen City Foundation.‚Äãüß≠ Respect and InclusionRespect is the foundation of martial arts. All students - regardless of mental and physical ability, gender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation - must be treated with equal dignity and respect. Proper behavior, discipline, and courtesy are essential for personal growth and a thriving community. üßë‍üè´ Proper Address & Ranking EtiquetteIn martial tradition, how you address your teacher and fellow students reflects humility and respect for the art. Your instructor should be addressed as Sifu (Cantonese for “teacher-father”). This signifies that you are accepted as a student. Using a first name alone is never appropriate. For public references, \"Sifu + Last Name\" or \"Master + Name\" may be used, but not when speaking directly to them", "metadata": {"source": "zencity_home", "title": "Online Martial Arts | Zen City Foundation", "description": "Discover the power of traditional Shaolin kung fu-live online!

Titles Based on Rank: 1st Black Belt and above (Disciples) - Show extra respect for their time and commitment. 2nd Black Belt & Assistant Instructor - Address as Lao Shi 3rd Black Belt & Instructor - Address as Sifu 5th Black Belt and above - Address as Master [First or Last Name] or Sifu, depending on their preference. üî∫ Instructor status (Sifu or Lao Shi) always outranks a student of the same sash/belt level. Black Belt students who have pre-tested are considered senior to those who haven’t, regardless of time at rank. üéì Classroom Conduct (Online)Even remotely, conduct yourself with the same discipline as you would in person. Be on time. Enter the Zoom room early and have your camera, attire, and space ready. Camera On: Maintain visibility to ensure proper instruction and engagement. Dress in uniform or workout attire", "metadata": {"source": "zencity_home", "title": "Online Martial Arts | Zen City Foundation", "description": "Discover the power of traditional Shaolin kung fu-live online!

Listen attentively to your Sifu and classmates. Avoid multitasking, eating, or unrelated activity during class. If late, wait quietly and bow (on camera) to acknowledge your Sifu before joining. üí¨ Communication and Conduct Speak only at the appropriate time. Do not interrupt your Sifu or others during instruction. When asking questions, do so respectfully and clearly. Avoid correcting or instructing classmates.

If your Sifu re-teaches something you’ve seen, listen carefully - it may include new concepts or corrections tailored to you. Do not teach material to other students unless authorized by the Head Instructor. Certified instructors undergo years of training in the Assistant Instructor Program and must remain in good standing. üßò Training Space and Discipline Choose a safe, quiet space for training. Remove furniture or hazards that could lead to injury. If training with others in the same space, bow when crossing paths and move respectfully.

You remain a student for life - regardless of your rank. Your Sifu will invite you to advance when your skill, attitude, and consistency demonstrate that you're ready. Never declare yourself ready to test. This is considered disrespectful. Ask for feedback and accept correction with humility. üéì Path to InstructorYou may qualify to join the Assistant Instructor Program if you: Are at least a 1st Brown Sash Love to teach and serve Can commit the time and responsibility Are in good standing with Chuan Wu Kung Fu Speak with the Head Instructor to express your interest.üí∞ Tuition & Accountability Tuition must be paid on time.

It connects us to the centuries-old traditions of martial arts and honors our instructors, classmates, and the art itself. The setting may be different, but the spirit remains the same.üåÄ When and How to Bow (Online) Before Joining the Class (Zoom or other platform): As you log in to class, pause for a brief standing bow before entering your training space or turning on your camera. This honors the start of your training session. Facing the Screen/Training Area: Bow when entering or exiting your training area, even at home.

{"content": ". Facing the Screen/Training Area: Bow when entering or exiting your training area, even at home. This simple act honors the tradition and centers your mind for practice. Before and After Practicing a Form: Stand and bow before beginning and after completing any form or drill. This shows respect to the founder of the form and those who have preserved it before you. When Addressing a Sifu or Higher-Ranking Student: Always bow (on camera) before speaking to your Sifu or a senior student. In a live class, a subtle standing bow before asking a question is a respectful gesture. If you're muted, use body language and eye contact to show attentiveness. When Your Sifu Enters the Online Class: At the start of the session, bow when your Sifu arrives on screen. You may be asked to bow together as a class when the gong or signal is given. Beginning and Ending the Class: All online classes begin and end with a group bow, just like in-person classes", "metadata": {"source": "zencity_home", "title": "Online Martial Arts | Zen City Foundation", "description": "Discover the power of traditional Shaolin kung fu-live online!

Students with higher rank or pre-test status are shown respect in group discussions or demonstrations. When breakout rooms are assigned, senior students may be asked to lead or assist. üßò‍‚ôÄÔ∏è Forms of Bowing (Online Adaptation)You may use the standing bow (hands by your sides, torso slightly inclined forward) in your own training space, facing your camera or training direction.

If both used the same salute or hand gesture, it revealed that they came from the same school or lineage - identifying each other as martial brothers and choosing not to fight. Even today, our bow is a gesture of unity, not ego.üí° Last Note on Bowing OnlineBowing may seem symbolic, but it carries the energy of your commitment and attitude", "metadata": {"source": "zencity_home", "title": "Online Martial Arts | Zen City Foundation", "description": "Discover the power of traditional Shaolin kung fu-live online!

Even from your living room or home dojo, a well-placed bow honors: Your instructor and their years of sacrifice Your peers walking the same path The tradition of the art you are privileged to study Make it a mindful part of every session - before the first move and after the final breath.‚ùóSigns of Disrespect in Online Martial Arts TrainingAdapted from contributions by Master David Theroff Martial arts training is not only about technique but also about discipline, respect, and personal integrity. Even in a virtual environment, these values remain essential. The following are examples of disrespectful behavior that should be avoided at all times during your online training: Joining the online class without bowing into your training space. This gesture remains important even in a virtual setting", "metadata": {"source": "zencity_home", "title": "Online Martial Arts | Zen City Foundation", "description": "Discover the power of traditional Shaolin kung fu-live online!

{"content": ". This gesture remains important even in a virtual setting. No shoes are allowed in the training area where barefoot is required. Prepare your training area according to traditional respect for cleanliness and readiness. Entering the Zoom room late or leaving early without notifying your Sifu in advance. Addressing a Master, Sifu, or Instructor without using their proper title. Always use \"Sifu,\" \"Master,\" or \"Lao Shi\" as appropriate. Pointing fingers, gesturing disrespectfully, or using dismissive body language on camera. Not paying attention while instruction is being given, multitasking during class, or openly disagreeing with what is being taught. Speaking poorly about any student, instructor, or program member either during or outside of class.

Expressing anger by slamming or throwing equipment, logging off abruptly, or using disrespectful gestures. Trying to teach material to others in breakout rooms or outside of class without the Head Instructor’s approval.

{"content": ". Damaging shared resources (e.g., Zoom settings, breakout room etiquette, recorded lessons) and failing to report or repair issues. Respect is not based on location - it lives in your actions. Whether you train in a studio or your living room, your behavior should reflect the values of the art. Show reverence for your instructor, peers, and the training itself. In martial arts, how you carry yourself matters as much as what you perform.üå± Final WordsRespect is not just about etiquette - it is a state of mind. It allows for humility in learning, trust in teaching, and growth in spirit. Your Sifu is your guide. Advancement will come through consistent practice, discipline, and a learning mindset - not from comparison, entitlement, or rushing. Train with heart. Practice with purpose. Grow with humility. - Chuan Wu Kung Fu Institute & Zen City Foundation Follow Zen City Foundation atABOUT USOur TeachersOur Staff", "metadata": {"source": "zencity_home", "title": "Online Martial Arts | Zen City Foundation", "description": "Discover the power of traditional Shaolin kung fu-live online!
